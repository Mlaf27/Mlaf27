# Hi there, I am Matthieu 👋

I'm pursuing a **Master of Management in Analytics** at McGill University. I specialize in **machine learning**, **data analytics**, and **strategic data solutions** with a passion for turning complex data into actionable business insights.

Currently, I work as a **Data Architect & Strategist** on academic consulting projects, where I develop machine learning solutions for real-world business challenges. My expertise spans **LLMs**, **predictive analytics**, **supply chain optimization**, and **data-driven decision-making**. I combine technical rigor with business acumen to solve meaningful problems.

**[PDF-Ingestion-Pipeline](https://github.com/Mlaf27/PDF-Ingestion-Pipeline)** - A robust data extraction and processing solution designed for enterprise-level document handling. This project demonstrates my ability to build scalable pipelines for data ingestion and transformation.

**[Spotify-Recommendation-Model](https://github.com/Mlaf27/Spotify-Recommendation-Model)** - A machine learning system that generates personalized playlist recommendations using hierarchical clustering techniques. This project showcases my skills in unsupervised learning and applying clustering algorithms to real-world music recommendation systems.

Open to discussing data science opportunities, collaboration, or interesting projects. Feel free to explore my repositories and reach out!

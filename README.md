# Hi there, I am Matthieu 👋

I'm pursuing a **Master of Management in Analytics** at McGill University. I specialize in **machine learning**, **data analytics**, and **strategic data solutions** with a passion for turning complex data into actionable business insights.

Currently, I work as a **Data Architect & Strategist** on academic consulting projects, where I develop machine learning solutions for real-world business challenges. My expertise spans **LLMs**, **predictive analytics**, and **data-driven decision-making**. I combine technical rigor with business acumen to solve meaningful problems.

**[kickstarter-success-prediction](https://github.com/Mlaf27/kickstarter-success-prediction)** -A machine learning system that predicts crowdfunding campaign success using classification and clustering techniques. This project showcases my skills in supervised and unsupervised learning, demonstrating how predictive models can identify key success factors in real-world campaign data.

**[Spotify-Recommendation-Model](https://github.com/Mlaf27/Spotify-Recommendation-Model)** - A machine learning system that generates personalized playlist recommendations using hierarchical clustering techniques. This project showcases my skills in unsupervised learning and applying clustering algorithms to real-world music recommendation systems.

Open to discussing data science opportunities, collaboration, or interesting projects. Feel free to explore my repositories and reach out!
